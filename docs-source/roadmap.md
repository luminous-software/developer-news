## Feature Ideas

The list below is a list of **potential** _features_ or _enhancements_.
These might be entirely **new features** or **enhancements** to existing features.

They may, or may not, end up being added into _Developer News_.

- [ ] Visual Studio Blog feed
- [ ] Visual Studio Twitter feed
- [ ] Azure DevOps Blog feed

Ticked items are available in the lastest version of _Developer News_.

## Contributions

If you'd like to implement one of the _feature ideas_,
feel free to [open an _Issue_ on GitHub][github-issue-fi] (with the same name as the feature),
and we can start a discussion there.

We can then work toward developing a pull request,
so the your feature can be incorporated into _Developer News_.

Don't forget to check out the [Contribution Guidelines][contribution-guidelines].
