And the installer only displays \nthree\n news items,\nwith a link to click on to \nsee more online\n. Except clicking on the link doesn't show you the rest of the developer news feed, \ninstead it opens a browser window to the Visual Studio Blog.\n\n\nIt was a very poor \nDeveloper News\n replacement!\n\n\n\n\nForum Announcement\n\u00b6\n\n\nFed up with the situation, I \nwrote a post in the Developer Community Forum\n to announce that\n\"\nI've decided to write a little extension to add a tool window to display the missing Developer News,\neither as a stop-gap until MS decide to see sense, or to use instead for the future going forward if they don't\n\".\n\n\nStart Page Is Back (or is it?)\n\u00b6\n\n\nAnother developer, \nJan Ku\u010dera\n, released an extension called  \nStart Page on Startup\n\nto restore access to the old VS 2017 \nStart Page\n. The page's code still existed in VS 2019,\nbut Microsoft simply \"hid\" access to it in the settings UI.\n\n\nThis of course therefore also restored \nDeveloper News\n, but at first it was \"broken\" and there was no UI for us to be able to \"fix\" it.\nHowever, after a few tweaks to the extension Jan had the news feed up and running again.\n\n\nThe only problem is that Jan's extension, as well as a few other people's extensions, \nrelied on simply displaying the \"hidden\" VS 2017 \nStart Page\n.\n\n\nAfter my announcement in the forum, a \nMicrosoft employee ominously pointed out\n,\nthat this code \"\nis subject to \nvanish at anytime\n\".\nAnd Microsoft did in fact rip the code out of VS 2019 in a later update, \nin spite of a \nlarge\n number of developers either \ndemanding\n or \nbegging\n for it to be returned. \n\n\nSo,\n\n\n\n\nfirst we had access to the old VS 2017 Start Page (when VS 2019 was released)\n\n\nwhen Microsoft found people were still using the old \nStart Page\n they \"hid\" it\n\n\nthen Jan's extension brought it back (it could also be displayed manually if you knew the trick)\n\n\nthen Microsoft ripped the _Start Page_code out of VS 2019 all together so it could no longer be displayed\n\n\nso any extensions that relied on the code for the old start page just stopped working\n\n\n\n\nMy next extension, called \nStart Page+\n, was written to create a \nnew\n start page \nfrom scratch\n,\nwith all of my own code. This meant that Microsoft had no control over and could not simply take it away from us.\n\n\nMy hope was to combine the best from the \nnon-modal\n VS 2017 \nStart \nPage\n (including \nDeveloper News\n)\nwith the layout of the much hated \nmodal\n VS 2019 _Start \nWindow\n, so hopefully everyone would feel at home.\n\n\nDeveloper News Is Back!\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nDeveloper News\n extension adds a new \ndockable tool window\n to display the same developer news feed\nthat VS 2017's \nStart Page\n used to provide, without relying on any Microsoft controlled code.\n\n\nTo open the new \nDeveloper News\n window:\n\n\n\n\nselect \nView\n | \nDeveloper News\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old \nDeveloper News\n feed is just the \nfirst\n developer-focused feed to be added to the new \nDeveloper News\n window,\nwith \nmore feeds to come\n in the near future (check out \nthe roadmap\n for more details).\n\n\nSupport the Project\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf \nDeveloper News\n has saved you time and hassle, please come back and show your support:\n\n\n\n\nyou could \nrate \nDeveloper News\n (only takes a couple of seconds)\n\n\nor \nreview \nDeveloper Newss\n (help others benefit from your experience)\n\n\nor \nshout me a coke\n (I don't drink coffee or beer lol)",
